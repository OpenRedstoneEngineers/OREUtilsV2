OREd
====
The Open Redstone Engineers' systems daemon
-------------------------------------------

OREd manages ORE's bukkit sessions and general game-related technical
infrustructure. OREd is bipartite. It first hosts an inter-host secure
network that allows all ORE programs to communicate easily over the
web. (Hereby dubbed "The ORE Network") Each ORE host sports OREd, and
upon starting the daemon connects to all available hosts. OREd
sessions connect to each other over a SSL connecction. Currently, all
ORE interfacing programs are clients to this network. They communicate
with their local OREd via a unix socket. All messages are passed to
either all clients, all clients of a category, or a specific
client. Currently, there are three types of client.
There are:

>The clients that are built into OREd, allowing the network to control
     its routing nodes. (Start/stop/move servers.)
>Bukkit server clients. Implemented as a threaded python plugin, these
     servers provide most of the interfacing in the system.
>Utility clients. Generally, does not receive commands, only sends and
     receives feedback.

OREd provides the following abilities beyond the network:
>MySQL configuration
>Bukkit server launching/stopping
